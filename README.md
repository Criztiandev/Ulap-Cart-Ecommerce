# **Ulap Cart** Ecommerce POC

Ulap Cart is an Ecommerce Proof of Concept (POC) that showcases the latest in design and technology. Developed by Criztain Dev, Ulap Cart is powered by the latest technology stack, MERN (MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, and NodeJS), which provides a robust and scalable foundation for the website's backend. The frontend is built using ReactJS, which ensures a seamless and intuitive user interface that is easy to navigate for customers. The website's sleek and modern appearance is due in part to the contributions of designer wardvisual, who helped create an intuitive and visually appealing user interface that makes it easy for customers to find what they need.
